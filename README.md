# Work-in-progress

Bookstack-Compose is a kotlin multi-platform application using the compose UI framework.

It runs on Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.

This app provides read-only access to a self-hosted Bookstack installation and allows you to read through the books, chapters and pages you've created.

This project is a work-in-progress and currently does not yet support several bookstack features, such as creating books and rendering markdown.
